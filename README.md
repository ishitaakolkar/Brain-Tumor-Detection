This repository provides tools and example models for brain tumor detection from MRI images. The goal is to support fast, accurate, and reproducible tumor diagnosis through automated analysis.

## Features

- End-to-end pipeline for preprocessing, training, and evaluation
- Deep learning models for tumor classification
- Example detection code and scripts in Python
- Open-source, extensible, and easy to use

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Recommended libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `torch`, `tensorflow`, `scikit-learn`, `opencv-python`
